# Database-CRUD-Operation-in-Python
In this project, I developed a command-line Python application for FilmFlix to manage their film database using SQLite3. The application allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, and I have implemented various features such as printing all records, adding, updating, and deleting records, as well as generating and displaying different reports based on SQL commands. This is an important step in helping FilmFlix efficiently manage its film database and make data-driven decisions.
